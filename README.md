# Arska Node
Arska Node makes your energy purchases greener and saves on your energy bill by demand-side flexibility, i.e. maximising usage of self produced (solar) energy and shifting energy purchase to cheapest and lower carbon intensive hours.

Arska Node is a microcontroller (ESP8266) based application for reading energy meters, sensors and controlling switches based on price, energy forecast and grid (consumption and production) information. Arska Node gets processes market and energy forecast data from Arska Server.
