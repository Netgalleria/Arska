# Arska Node
Arska Node makes your energy purchases greener and saves on your energy bill by demand-side flexibility, i.e. maximising usage of self produced (solar) energy and shifting energy purchase to cheapest and lower carbon intensive hours.

Arska Node is a microcontroller (ESP8266) based application for managing energy comsumption. It can switch on and of loads  based on measured consumption and production information as well as price and renevable energy forecast. Arska Node gets processed market and energy forecast data from Arska Server (optional).
